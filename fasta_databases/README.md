# FASTAs

This folder contains all databases which have been used (all at once) to search in the original QC-Workflow

## Special Note: MPC-SPIKEINS

This FASTA-Database was modified in order to fit to the `spike_ins.csv` for the XIC-Extraction. Mainly we added each entry seperately and gave them a custom accession to have a non-ambigous mapping.
